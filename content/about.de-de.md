Hi there! I am a science enthusiast focused on python and java-based development, and machine learning.

In 2008 I received a BS in [mechanical engineering](http://itcelaya.edu.mx/), from the technical university of Celaya, Mexico, and a MS degree in mechatronics in 2010, from the technical university of Aachen ([FH Aachen](https://www.fh-aachen.de/)).

For the first part of my carrer I focused in the developmet of algorithms for the alignment of optical components in optronic devices. First working as a research assistant at the [IPT](https://www.ipt.fraunhofer.de/en.html) Fraunhofer Institute and later as a developer at MA Micro Automation.

For the last four to five years I have been focusing in backend development and machine learning on different projects.

Happily, I was accepted in [Mensa](https://www.mensa.org/) in 2018.
