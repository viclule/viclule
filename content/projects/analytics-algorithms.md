Modern systems and devices generate more data than never before and the tendency is to keep increasing. In previous years it was not feasible to extract value out of that data, but recent storage and processing price decreases are enabling new applications and business opportunities.

There are a wide range of applications:

- Machinery cost reduction. Replace expensive sensors with models relying on available data
- Anomaly detection. Detect in real time malfunctioning of devices based on historical data. The same principle can be applied to analyze operations, such as identifying fraud and misuse of products or services
- Segmentation and Classification. Classify a population based on data they generate
- Image Recognition. Customized image recognition for complex tasks
